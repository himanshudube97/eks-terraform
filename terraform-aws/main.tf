# --------------------
# Concept Recap:
# --------------------
# - A subnet is considered public if:
#   1. It is associated with a route table that routes to an Internet Gateway.
#   2. It assigns public IPs to instances (map_public_ip_on_launch = true).
#
# - A subnet is private if:
#   1. It does NOT route to an Internet Gateway.
#   2. It routes to a NAT Gateway instead for outbound internet access.
#
# - Public subnet = direct internet access.
# - Private subnet = indirect internet access via NAT.
# - Internet Gateway = required for public resources (e.g., load balancers).
# - NAT Gateway = required for private resources (e.g., EKS nodes) to access internet without being exposed.

# 🧠 So why does NAT Gateway need an Elastic IP, but IGW doesn’t?
# ✅ 1. IGW is not a device you own
# The Internet Gateway is AWS-managed, and it’s not tied to a single instance or IP address.

# It just bridges your VPC to the internet.

# It doesn't require an IP because it routes traffic from EC2 instances that already have public IPs.

# Think of it as a toll gate on a highway — it doesn't need a license plate; your car (the EC2 instance) has the license (public IP).

# ✅ 2. NAT Gateway is a specific AWS resource
# A NAT Gateway is an actual managed resource placed in your public subnet.

# It needs a public IP address (Elastic IP) so it can:

# Receive response traffic from the internet.

# Forward outbound traffic from private subnets to the internet.

# Think of the NAT Gateway as a middleman with a phone number (Elastic IP) — if your private instances want to talk to the internet, the NAT forwards messages and receives responses on their behalf using that public IP.
