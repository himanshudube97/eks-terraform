# ENI stands for Elastic Network Interface.

# It is a virtual network card in AWS â€” just like a network adapter on a physical computer or a VM.

# ðŸ§  Think of it like this:
# An ENI is how AWS resources like EC2 instances or EKS control planes connect to your VPC â€” it's their "network port" that gives them an IP address and lets them send/receive data.
# As we do the setup of EKS, the ENIs are created in the private subnets you specified. This allows the EKS control plane to communicate with your worker nodes and other AWS services securely within your VPC.
