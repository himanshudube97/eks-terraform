# Terraform AWS VPC with Public & Private Subnets, NAT Gateway, and Internet Gateway

This Terraform configuration provisions a secure and scalable VPC setup in AWS, including public and private subnets, an Internet Gateway (IGW), a NAT Gateway, and routing rules for internet access. It is ideal for environments like EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) where you want public access for load balancers and private networking for sensitive resources like databases or worker nodes.
